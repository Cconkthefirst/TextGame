# TextGame

Game created by me and my partner Zach Zwanzig, inspired by the classic text-based adventure games like Zork. Built Freshman year to demonstrate the knowledge of object-oriented programming we had at the time. My contributions were the UI, player movement, character, and item. We both worked on main.cpp.

## Welcome to the Labyrinth!

You have heard tell of an ancient, powerful artifact known as The Macguffin, rumored to be resting in the center of the Minotaur's labyrinth.
Many adventurers have attempted to make the perilous journey to claim this wonderful prize, but none who enter have returned to tell the tale.
Perhaps YOU will be the one to find the center of the maze, claim the Macguffin, and return home a hero!


## The goal:

Find your way through the maze, collect the four keys, slay the Minotaur, and claim the Macguffin!

# How to play?

**NOTE: ALL INPUTS SHOULD BE IN LOWERCASE!!!**

While moving through the dungeon, it is important to know all the things you can do!

**north**

* Moves the player north, if possible

**south**

* Moves the player south, if possible

**east**

* Moves the player east, if possible

**west**

* Moves the player west, if possible

**fight**

* If there's a monster in the room, fight to the death!

**escape**

* If the monster looks too tough, there's no shame in turning tale to return later once you're more powerful

**pickup**

* If there's an item in the room, adds the item to your inventory! There are weapons, armor, and... a rock?

**equip**

* Choose an item to equip from your inventory. Armor makes you harder to kill, and weapons make your attacks stronger!

**record**

* There are riddles and puzzles in the labyrinth, so writing them down in your notebook can be useful.

**pnotebook**

* And you always need a way to see those hints you've written down! And any pictures of cats you've drawn... Those are good, too.

**stats**

* Prints out your current health, attack power, and inventory. It's important to keep all your ducks in a line!

**heal**

* Sometimes, it can be nice to stop and smell the roses, and if a room allows it, you can reset your health to max!

**description**

* Want to see the description of a room again? Well, here ya go!

**help**

* Prints out a shorter version of these instructions with all the accepted commands.

**quit**

* If, heaven forbid, you decide you DON'T want to play the game, this allows you to exit the game early... But who would use that?
